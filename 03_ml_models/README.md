# Applications of Machine Learning models

## Session A: Other pre-trained models

### Objectives:
* Understanding how to use pre-trained models other than image classification.
* Ability to work with PoseNet and ml5.js
* Ability to work with Object Detection Models (CoCoSSD).
* Ability to work with Image Segmentation models (UNet and BodyPix) and ml5.js.
* [Week 3 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kOjvIWjsCKYPEuS3lUjg3jYWGXiFIuCOvU6JUq_ESmo/edit?usp=sharing)

## Session B: Coming Soon!

### Assignment 3, due Monday Sept 28:
1. Read [Real-Time Human Pose Estimation in the Browser with TensorFlow.js](https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5) by Dan Oved, with editing and illustrations by Irene Alvarado and Alexis Gallo.
2. Read [Mixing movement and machine](https://medium.com/artists-and-machine-intelligence/mixing-movement-and-machine-848095ea5596) by Maya Man
4. Read [Review of Deep Learning Algorithms for Image Semantic Segmentation](https://medium.com/@arthur_ouaknine/review-of-deep-learning-algorithms-for-image-semantic-segmentation-509a600f7b57) by Arthur Ouaknine
5. Read [Humans of AI](https://humans-of.ai/editorial) by Philipp Schmitt
6. Explore [COCO Dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#explore). What surprises you about this data set? How is it similar or different to ImageNet? What questions do you have? Can you think of any ethical considerations around how this data was collected? Are there privacy considerations with the data?

More details coming soon!
