### Background: Perceptron and Artifical Neural Networks
* [What is a Neural Network?](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) by 3Blue1Brown
* Invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory ([original paper](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs501/Rosenblatt1958.pdf)), a perceptron is the simplest neural network possible: a computational model of a single neuron. A perceptron consists of one or more inputs, a processor, and a single output. ([More to this history](https://github.com/ml5js/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA-F19/wiki/Brief-History-of-Artificial-Neural-Networks)
* [NOC Neural Network videos](https://youtu.be/XJ7HLz9VYz0?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh) - 10.1 to 10.3 cover the "Perceptron", a model of a single neuron. The Perceptron forms the basis of modern multi-layer deep learning networks.
* [NOC Neural Network chapter 10](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-10-neural-networks/) - written explanation of Perceptron and accompanying code in 10.1 to 10.4.
